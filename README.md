Many schools are closed on snow days due to slippery conditions and cold weather. School closings are announced on local TV and radio stations. But sometimes you have to watch or listen for a long time before they announce your school. Shannon's dad is the principal and that means Shannon gets early notification of school closings. Shannon then calls her best friends Angelina and Sofia. Then Angelina calls two of her best friends and Sofia calls two of her best friends. The phone tree then continues by each person calling exactly two other people and no one is called more than once.

We are going to assume that all students want to get back to sleep as soon as possible. So they are not going to chat and each call will take exactly one minute.
Shannon finds out that there is no school and makes her first call at 6:00 AM. Ten minutes later at 6:10 AM everyone on the phone chain is back in bed. How many phone calls have been made?
